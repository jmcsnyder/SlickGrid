# Welcome to SlickGrid

Find documentation and examples in [the wiki](https://github.com/jmcsnyder/SlickGrid/wiki).


**UPDATE:  December 8th, 2015, As a user of SlickGrid I decided to make a fork of this project.  My goal is to fix known bugs, add useful features, and provide some nifty examples of how to implement SlickGrid into your application.**

## SlickGrid is an advanced JavaScript grid/spreadsheet component

Some highlights:

* Adaptive virtual scrolling (handle hundreds of thousands of rows with extreme responsiveness)
* Extremely fast rendering speed
* Supports jQuery UI Themes
* Background post-rendering for richer cells
* Configurable & customizable
* Full keyboard navigation
* Column resize/reorder/show/hide
* Column autosizing & force-fit
* Pluggable cell formatters & editors
* Support for editing and creating new rows.
* Grouping, filtering, custom aggregators, and more!
* Advanced detached & multi-field editors with undo/redo support.
* “GlobalEditorLock” to manage concurrent edits in cases where multiple Views on a page can edit the same data.
* Support for [millions of rows](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2569488/1269037)
